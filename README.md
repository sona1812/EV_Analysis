 ## Conclusion and Recommendations 
 * Average EV Penetration Rate for last 3 Fiscal Years is **3.6%**.Notably, states such as **Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu** have consistently performed above this national average. **Goa**
   stands out with the highest average EV penetration rate at **9.8%**, indicating a strong regional adoption of electric vehicles.
 * Given the significantly higher EV penetration rates in states like Goa (9.8%), Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, the company should prioritize market expansion and investment in these regions. 
   These states demonstrate strong consumer readiness and infrastructure support for EV adoption.
 * States such as **Manipur, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh**, and **Nagaland** have recorded the lowest EV penetration rates, while **Sikkim** has reported **zero EV penetration** over the last three fiscal years.
   May be **Geographical terrain** in these states pose challenges, potentially impacting accessibility, infrastructure development, and logistical operations.
 * To improve EV penetration in these states, the company can **Collaborate with state governments to promote EV awareness and infrastructure development**.
 * The EV market has grown nearly **fourfold** in terms of penetration from **2022 to 2024**, suggesting rising consumer acceptance, better infrastructure, or stronger government incentives.
 * Although two-wheelers account for **92.6%** of the total EV sales volume, **four-wheelers contribute more significantly in terms of revenue**.This reflects the higher unit cost of four-wheelers, indicating 
   that while two-wheelers dominate in quantity, four-wheelers drive the majority of value in the EV market.
 * So company should expand product offerings and marketing efforts in the four-wheeler EV segment to capitalize on higher revenue potential per unit and continue investing in the two-wheeler segment to maintain 
   and grow market share, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities where affordability and convenience drive demand.
 * **Ola Electric** is the leading manufacturer in terms of EV sales, primarily driven by its dominance in the two-wheeler segment. **Tata Motors**, on the other hand, holds a strong position in the four-wheeler 
   EV market and leads in terms of revenue generation.
 * **March** consistently emerges as the peak month for electric vehicle (EV) sales across multiple years, indicating a seasonal surge in consumer demand. The company should strategically align its marketing 
   campaigns, promotional offers, and inventory planning to capitalize on this seasonal peak. Initiatives such as year-end discounts, exchange benefits, and targeted digital advertising during February and early 
   March can further enhance sales performance.
 * **Goa, Arunachal Pradesh, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands** exhibit a very **high Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**, indicating emerging and growing markets. Goa, however, is an exception, as the other 
   states have relatively low penetration rates, providing significant room for adoption and expansion.
